	* mainframe.tcl: Modified menu creation/setmenustate functions to support
	a new model of menustate.  Instead of enabling/disabling a menu item 
	whenever any one of its tags changes state, now it only enables menu items
	if all of its tags are set.  This makes it really easy to, say, only enable
	the "New Action" entry if both a project is open and an element is selected.

	* notebook.tcl: Added some (non-functional) code for doing
	tab-notebooks with the tabs on the bottom.
