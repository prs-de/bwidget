	* mainframe.tcl:  Fixed _destroy to unset ALL state variables, so that
	when a new MainFrame of the same name as an old one is created, it doesn't
	pick up residual state from the old one.

	* mainframe.tcl: Modified menu creation/setmenustate functions to support
	a new model of menustate.  Instead of enabling/disabling a menu item 
	whenever any one of its tags changes state, now it only enables menu items
	if all of its tags are set.  This makes it really easy to, say, only enable
	the "New Action" entry if both a project is open and an element is selected.

	* buttonbox.tcl: Added tagging mechanism to buttonbox.  When using
	$bbox add, the first parameter is a list of tags for the button.  Then
	use $bbox setbuttonstate to change the state of a tag.

	* notebook.tcl: Added some (non-functional) code for doing
	tab-notebooks with the tabs on the bottom.
