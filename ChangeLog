	* combobox.tcl: Removed code that cleared entry selection on focus out 
	events, as this crippled exportselection.

1999-10-29  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* buttonbox.tcl: Added a gettags function, which allows the user to query
	the tags that are used on buttons in the buttonbox.

1999-10-29  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* font.tcl: Added one new flag: -querysystem.  This lets the user 
	control whether the font selector queries the system (via font families)
	for the list of fonts, or if it uses a preset list of fonts (which is
	much faster and less likely to crash some systems).

1999-10-25  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* font.tcl: Added support for two new flags: -families and -styles; 
	-families allows you to specify one of all, fixed, or variable, to limit 
	the choice of fonts to those fonts; -styles allows you to specify a list
	of styles that can be set with the widget (ie, bold, italic, etc).

	* tree.tcl: Fixed some problems with keyboard traversal.  Added
	support for left/right arrows a la MS Explorer.
	Added support for keyboard-based scrolling.

	* tree.tcl: Added a -selectable option to tree nodes, which
	controls whether or not a given node is selectable (duh).  This
	works with the new -selectcommand option for the tree, and with
	keyboard traversal (also new).  Now, whenever the tree gets a
	"selection set", it calls the given -selectcommand with the name
	of the tree and the list of selected nodes, which makes it easier
	to just drop in place and use.

1999-10-15  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* panedw.tcl: Added a -class PanedWindow option to the main frame 
	(the megawidget) of the paned window.

1999-10-15  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* dialog.tcl: Added an overrideredirect option to Dialog::draw, which
	allows the user to control the overrideredirect state of the dialog.

1999-09-19  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* mainframe.tcl:  Fixed _destroy to unset ALL state variables, so that
	when a new MainFrame of the same name as an old one is created, it
	doesn't pick up residual state from the old one.

1999-09-17  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com

	* mainframe.tcl: Modified menu creation/setmenustate functions to
	support a new model of menustate.  Instead of enabling/disabling a
	menu item whenever any one of its tags changes state, now it only
	enables menu items if all of its tags are set.  This makes it
	really easy to, say, only enable the "New Action" entry if both a
	project is open and an element is selected.

	* buttonbox.tcl: Added tagging mechanism to buttonbox.  When using
	$bbox add, the first parameter is a list of tags for the button.  Then
	use $bbox setbuttonstate to change the state of a tag.

1999-09-16  Eric Melski  <ericm@scriptics.com>

	* notebook.tcl: Added some (non-functional) code for doing
	tab-notebooks with the tabs on the bottom.
